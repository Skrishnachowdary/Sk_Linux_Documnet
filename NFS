Class 1: Introduction to NFS and System Preparation
Objective: Understand NFS, prepare the system for NFS installation.

    Introduction to NFS:
        Define NFS and its purpose.
        Explain client-server architecture.
        Discuss advantages of using NFS.

    System Preparation:
        Ensure a clean installation of a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Server).
        Update the system: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y.
        Install necessary packages: sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server.

Class 2: Configuring NFS Server
Objective: Learn how to configure the NFS server.

    Understanding Exports:
        Explain the concept of exports in NFS.
        Discuss the /etc/exports file.

    Configuring Exports:
        Edit the /etc/exports file to define shared directories.
        Explain export options (read-only, read-write, etc.).

    Managing NFS Services:
        Start, stop, and restart NFS service: sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server.

Class 3: Client Configuration and Access Control
Objective: Configure NFS clients and control access to shared directories.

    Configuring NFS Clients:
        Install NFS client packages on client machines.
        Mount NFS shares on clients: sudo mount -t nfs server_ip:/shared_directory /mount_point.

    Access Control:
        Discuss NFS security considerations.
        Implement basic access control using /etc/exports.

Class 4: Advanced NFS Configuration
Objective: Explore advanced NFS configurations.

    NFS Version and Protocols:
        Discuss NFS versions (e.g., NFSv3, NFSv4).
        Explore NFS protocols and their differences.

    NFS Options and Tuning:
        Explain additional options in /etc/exports.
        Discuss tuning options for performance.

Class 5: Troubleshooting and Monitoring
Objective: Learn how to troubleshoot common issues and monitor NFS.

    Troubleshooting:
        Identify common NFS issues.
        Use logs (/var/log/syslog) for debugging.

    Monitoring NFS:
        Discuss tools for monitoring NFS performance (e.g., nfsstat, nfsstat -c).

Class 6: NFS Security and Best Practices
Objective: Understand NFS security measures and best practices.

    Securing NFS:
        Implement NFS security measures (firewall rules, Kerberos authentication).
        Discuss secure NFS configurations.

    Best Practices:
        Share best practices for NFS server configuration.
        Discuss performance optimization tips.

By the end of these classes, students should have a comprehensive understanding of setting up and configuring an NFS server in various scenarios, troubleshooting common issues, and implementing security measures.
