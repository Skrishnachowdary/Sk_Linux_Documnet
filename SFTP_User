Step 1 – Create Atlantic.Net Cloud Server

Once you are logged into your CentOS 8 server, run the following command to update your base system with the latest available packages.


dnf update -y

    	​ Step 2 – Create an SFTP User
First, you will need to create a new user with only file transfer access. You can create a new user named sftp using the following command:
adduser krishna


Next, set the password for the above user:
passwd krishna

Provide your desired password and hit enter.



    	​ Step 3 – Create a Directory Structure for File Transfers
Next, you will need to create a directory structure for file transfer to restrict SFTP access to one directory.
You can create a new directory with the following command:

mkdir -p /opt/krishna/public


Next, set the ownership of the /opt/sftp/ directory to root:

chown root:root /opt/krishna


Next, give proper permissions with the following command:


chmod 755 /opt/krishna


Next, set the ownership of the public directory to the sftp user:

chown krishna:krishna /opt/krishna/public
    	​ Step 4 – Configure SSH for SFTP
Next, you will need to configure SSH to restrict access to one directory and disallow terminal access to the sftp user.
You can do it by editing the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config


Add the following lines at the end of the file:

Match User krishna
ForceCommand internal-sftp
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChrootDirectory /opt/krishna
PermitTunnel no
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no



AllowUsers krishna shiva shankar venky
PasswordAuthentication yes

Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match User krishna
	ChrootDirectory /opt/krishna/uploadfiles
	ForceCommand internal-sftp


Save and close the file when you are finished. Then, restart the SSH service to implement the changes:

systemctl restart sshd

    	​ Step 5 – Verify SFTP
Now, verify the SFTP access with the following command:
sftp krishna@18.141.164.240
